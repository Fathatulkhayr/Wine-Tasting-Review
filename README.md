Comprehensive Report on Wine Review Analysis
Introduction
The goal of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from a dataset of wine reviews. By applying text mining, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling techniques, we aim to understand common themes, customer sentiments, and key descriptive elements in wine reviews.
1. Data Preprocessing and Text Mining
Before performing any analysis, we cleaned and prepared the dataset by:
Converting text to lowercase
Removing punctuation and numbers
Eliminating stopwords
Applying stemming to reduce words to their root forms
Corpus Cleaning and Tokenization
A corpus was created from the wine descriptions, and stopwords were removed to ensure only meaningful words remained. Stemming was then applied to standardize words into their base forms.
Word Frequency Analysis
A word frequency count was conducted to identify the most common words appearing in reviews. Below is a bar chart showcasing the top 20 words:

A word cloud was also generated to visualize frequently occurring terms in a more intuitive manner.

2. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was performed using the Bing lexicon to classify words as either positive or negative. This helped us determine the overall sentiment distribution of wine reviews.
Sentiment Distribution
A sentiment distribution chart was generated to show the relative frequencies of positive and negative words in reviews.



Positive and Negative Word Clouds
Separate word clouds were created to highlight the most common positive and negative words used in the reviews.
Positive Words: 



Negative Words: 


3. Topic Modeling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to extract major topics from the dataset. The top 10 terms for each topic were identified, revealing key themes discussed in the reviews.

4. Advanced Text Analysis
TF-IDF Analysis
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) was computed to identify the most unique and important words in the dataset.

Bigram Analysis
A bigram analysis was performed to uncover commonly occurring word pairs in reviews, helping to identify descriptive phrases often used by customers.
